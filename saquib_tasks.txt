Yo so I'll be flying tonight and won't be able to help you guys out 
starting next task. But should be pretty easy to start off with.

First thing is to get your miner to start saving results to the 
filesystem. Create a directory called data and just save the output of 
your miner there. Filename is the resulting hash and contents of the file 
are the raw prefix+hashes+nonce saved as bytes.

Next Create an index directory which will keep your spv lists. So when you 
give your miner some data to mine onto a keyword, once it's mined the 
result, it will save the hash to the end of the spv list for that keyword.

Would be good to also prompt user for data input and then save that in the 
data directory as well (e.g. file named 
6eb228fb5b59ab49a45a48bdd9e5f0ed65b43afb52ec72cc825a567986630827 would 
just contain the word "beans")

So once you have those 3 things you should be able to mine index data and 
save it properly. Now you can create an archiver. So you'll take your own 
index data and create tar files similar to what I gave you guys last week. 
Don't copy my 21e8-engine code it's hard to follow and not efficient.

Archiver is pretty simple. Given a keyword, get all of the related index 
data, hash the spvlist for the keyword and mine that with a prefix length 
higher than the difficulty of all the index data included. Also add any 
data files related to the hashes to the tar.
